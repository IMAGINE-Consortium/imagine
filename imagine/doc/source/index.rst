Welcome to the documentation of the
`IMAGINE software package <https://github.com/IMAGINE-Consortium/imagine/>`_,
a publicly available Bayesian platform that allows
using a variety of observational data sets to constrain models for
the main ingredients of the interstellar medium of the Galaxy.
IMAGINE calculates simulated data sets from the galaxy models and compares these to
the observational data sets through a likelihood evaluation.
It then samples this multi-dimensional likelihood space, which allows one to
update prior knowledge, and thus to find the position with the
:ref:`best-fit model <posterior>` parameters and/or compute the
:ref:`model evidence <evidence>` (which enables rigorous comparison of competing
models).

IMAGINE is developed and maintained by the
`IMAGINE consortium <https://www.astro.ru.nl/imagine/>`_,
a diverse group of researchers whose common interest revolves
around developing an integrated understanding of the various components of the
Galactic interstellar medium (with emphasis on the Galactic magnetic field and
its interaction with cosmic rays). For more details on IMAGINE science case,
please refer to the
`IMAGINE whitepaper <https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/08/049>`_.
